# MultiScreensInOneDemo
Demo History screen in Coinhako app. Multi screens in one screen. 
I am using Coinhako as my wallet for my ETH and find some interesting UI in it. Just challenge myself to find out how their developers make it done. 

First challenge is History screen. See detail at my note: http://kynguyen.space/2018/03/29/coinhako-history-demo.html
